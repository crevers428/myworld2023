Please note you should not apply if you do not have vast experience with helping out at competitions. The application process is outlined in the myWorlds section of the website. All staff applications will be reviewed by WCA delegates and the WC2019 Core Organisation Team and all approval decisions will be final. Approval as a staff member may take some time as we will review each application in depth and ask for feedback from your local Delegates. Please stay attentive to your emails throughout this as we may need to contact you with further questions that we may have. As a staff member you will receive certain benefits in consideration of your participation as a staff member, for example this will include free registration into the competition and other benefits to be announced closer to the date. You must register and then apply for staff and receive a refund once you have completed your assignments at the competition.
